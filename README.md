# Battleship Game

You have five ships:  
carrier - occupies 5 cells  
battleship - 4 cells  
cruiser - 3 cells  
submarine - 3 cells  
destroyer - 2 cells.  
  
First, you have to set up your ships on the grid. Once all your ships are on the grid, the game starts and you are the
first to shoot at your opponent's ships.  
  
The game is written in python 2.7 back in 2013 and depends on Python Imaging Library (PIL) modules, so you need to install them from pythonware.com/products/pil
